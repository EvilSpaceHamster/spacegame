			<h2>Humanity has changed</h2>
			
			<p>The universe knows of three human races:</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt id="plussers">Plussers</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The law of accelerating returns created the plussers. Some humans embraced
					change at break-neck speeds. When men started to merge with machine, create
					lifeforms and alter the world on a sub-atomic scale, a war broke out. Some
					called it the mecha-crusades. Man fought man over his most brilliant creation:
					a thinking machine. The armies fought until a ceasefire was called. The machinists left for mars to set up the "United Cybarian Council for Humanity Plus" or as the <a href="#reggers">Reggers</a> call them: Plussers.</p>
					<p>Mars became a paradise. It's surface was terraformed with great red valleys,	vibrant green rainforests and opal freshwater oceans. The cities were small on the surface, but underground, the Trans-Cybarian Delivery System (TCDS) connected massive sub-martian cities. The core of the planet was one giant simulator with	micro star-tunnels connecting the cybarian colonies across, and indeed within the
					stars</p>
				</dd>
				<dt id="reggers">Reggers</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>As the war raged on earth. The zealots created a government to drive out
					the Machinists. With technology playing prey to their crusades, the Terran Purity
					Senate increased surveilence and turned the garden of the solar system into
					totalitarian nightmare.</p>
					<p>As their battles with the machinists persisted on the seas, the continents of
					earth gave rise to another enemy, the Regular Human Resistance. Poised with liberating
					Humanity from zealotry, the reggers fought a sustained campaign and eventually turned
					the Earth into a democracy once more. Although humanity was once more at peace, the relationship between Reggers and <a href="#plussers">Plussers</a> was damaged. Plussers share little with the reggers, leading them to be seen as mysterious.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Hoppers</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Before the Senate took power, even before the war, there were the adventurers, the pirates and the explorers. In their primitive starboats, they flew around the galaxy exploring, charting and making contact with aliens. They called themselves the hoppers. Hoppers were laid back, they tried everything they could and the made friends with almost everyone they met. Reggers Have another nae for Hoppers: star-hippies. Hoppers and <a href="#plussers">Plussers</a> are on good terms. Often sharing starcharts and contacts.

			<p>
			They came from the forbidden zone.
			</p>
			<p>
			That dark region of interstellar space,
			trapped in the crucible of a gravity well,
			there are no stars. A sick prank played by
		   	the gods, where orphaned planets drift to
			their doom.
			</p>
			<p>
			The captains of the age of the starships called
			it haunted. Even when starships were still used,
			no one would dare to sail into that dark evil
			hole. It is 2660. Humanity is still planetbound,
			but unlike those unfortunate souls before the early
			22nd century, this is by choice.
			It is the age of the Startunnel, regular humans travel
			to other planets by train, living at a pace that suits
			them, a pace the plussers would say was lazy, and goes
			against humanity's heart of discover.
			Unlike the complacent contentment of the majority of
			humanity, the plussers took to the stars, augmenting
			their minds, bodies, and as some would have it, their
			souls, with great thinking machines from the size of a
			molecule to the size of a small sun. They took some planets
			in human space, most notably Mars, but their core is inside
			the suns of barren systems they have engineered to be
			paradises and temples to sapience.

			The transmission was picked up by a Hopper. Those lost souls
			who take to the stars for the sake of adventure and indeed
			to find some meaning in the hedonistic modern age.
			The captain got the assembly a description. His transmission
		   	read:
			</p>
			<p style="padding:20px;">
			A light from the crucible. Purple. Beautiful. It came from
			an animal. Like a ray it swam through space, flapping its
			wings, gliding through solar winds. Its hull had a purple...
			star in a central circular hole. It messaged us. It wasn't
			an animal. It was a ship. The noise. I'll never forget the
			noise. Screaming. Endless screaming. Theres more now. There
			must be 300. They...they. MY MIND, THEY ARrggh HELP!! -----
			</p>
			<p>
			The transmission cut off from the hopper ship. It wasn't seen
			again.
			</p>
			<p>
			We need a fleet. The 5 biggest manufacturers have started
			production. A ship hasn't been made in 50 years. All we have
			are Ion engines, and our fusion reactors cant be made for 
			starships for years. Our space technology is old, but by god,
			it will speed up now. All our components are modular. We learnt
			that lesson from the near-destruction of the ISS in 2053.
			</p>
			<p>
			You are the captain of the flagship now. You represent Humanity.
			The other races in the galaxy know us as an isolationist culture,
			thats about to change. Trade with the ETs as much as possible. We
			will offer you rewards for their tech. We include the plussers in
			that. They forked from humanity a while ago, we need to remerge our
			stories.
			</p>
			<p>
			That transmission changed the landscape of the universe. Find out
			what happened.
